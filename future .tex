\section{Future work and Futher possible development}
\begin{itemize}
\item A deep analysis on the manufacturing procedure of the foam is required to be done so as find out the feasibility of the design proposed in the project. 

\item A turbulent model of the reynolds and nusselt numbers for a two phased turbulent flow model can be constructed.

\item The model for the overall flow in the boiler can be constructed.

\item The typer of flow i.e laminar an turbulent flow Can be modeled on cellular level. 

\item The accurate tranisition model of phase for various phase in the multiphase model can be constructed.

\item The assumption that the confinement of the bubble can be eliminated just by modifying the presented code to consider all the phase tranition.

\item If the minimum temperatur profile along the centeral axis is constructed the model will be capable of simulating any model of any foam with any cell structure. 

\end{itemize}
