\section{Abstract}

One of the important components of a steam power plant plant is the boiler, which are used to heat the up steam that goes into the turbine. Metal foam based on the current research going on is proving to be a very good heat transfer medium. So we are applying the metal foams as one of the heat transfer medium in the boiler. We have idealized the foam design on cellular level following the design proposed by lord kelvin and have computed the variation of the temperature along radial direction;  pressure, velocity and  quality of the steam along the axis boiler. The obtained simulation and coding results are compared to the model of the boiler without the foam, there by finding out the effectiveness of the metal foam as medium of heat transfer in the boiler.\cite{Boomsma2011}
