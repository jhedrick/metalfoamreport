\chapter{Abstract}

One of the important components of a steam power plant plant is the boiler, which is used to heat the up steam that goes into the turbine. 
Metal foams are proving to be a very good heat transfer medium, and a topic of research interest. By applying the metal foams as one of the heat transfer medium in the boiler, it is shown that there is significant heat transfer enhancement to a saturated liquid phase change process at typical Rankine power cycle boiler inlet pressure. 
We have idealized the foam design on cellular level following the design proposed by Lord Kelvin and have computed the variation of the temperature along radial direction; pressure, velocity and  quality of the steam are reported along the axis boiler using convergence methods.
The obtained simulation and coding results are compared to the model of the boiler without the foam, there by finding out the effectiveness of the metal foam as medium of heat transfer in the boiler.\cite{Boomsma2011}
